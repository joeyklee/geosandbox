# Contributing to the GeoSandBox

So you're thinking of contributing to the GeoSandBox - that's GREAT! we ❤️ you. This document should help you get started.
Three things you should know

## There are three things you should know:

    This is a friendly community. We want to welcome everyone who is interested. For this reason, we have rules about how people can behave in the community, and we will enforce them. The bottom line is that you must respect others, but you can read about what that means specifically below.
    We are moving fast but want to maintain a high-quality project. For this reason we have specific working processes in place. We're strict about the standard of work we allow into the project - but we're nice about it! If you'd like help contributing, we'll be happy to guide you.
    We really care about our contributors, and we want to make it easy for you to become one. If our documentation is confusing, that's our fault. If it's not clear how you can get involved - that's our fault. If you're unsure of how to follow the rules, that's our fault. In any of those cases please come and tell us about it, we'll fix things ASAP.

## The community code of conduct

The internet is often an unfriendly place. Some people are systematically excluded from online spaces or made to feel unwelcome or uncomfortable. We don't want that to happen here. The more different voices and skillsets we have in the community, the more robust our decisions will be and the better our project will become.

It's not always obvious to people who create an unwelcoming atmosphere that they are doing so. So we've got some specific rules that YOU MUST READ BEFORE CONTRIBUTING.

Go and read the rules.

## How to help with the GeoSandBox

The GeoSandBox is a project for teaching and learning the geo web libraries out there. Chances are you've got skills that could help us.

If you're interested in developing a set of lessons for the GeoSandBox, please go to the issues and drop me a line and we can discuss a way to integrate your lessons. Many thanks!
